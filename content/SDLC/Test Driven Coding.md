![[Four Levels of Testing.png]]
There are mainly four types of testing:
1. Unit
2. Integration
3. System
4. Acceptance

White Box Testing: Tester has idea about the code.
Black Box Testing: Tester has no idea about the code.

Test can be categorised in other ways:
1. Functional: If the features are in line with the business requirements 
2. Non-Functional: Performance and quality of the product.
3. Maintenance: Operational environment

In the acceptance test the system is thought to be quite stable and bug free. A few software is handed out to the stake-holders and testers there are mainly three phases here:
1. Beta
2. Alpha
3. Regression
