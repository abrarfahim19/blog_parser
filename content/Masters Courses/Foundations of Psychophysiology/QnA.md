1. what is p value in the study?
Ans: In a statistical measure it helps us to determine the significance of results. It indicates the probability that the observed results are occurred by chance. Typically, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, meaning there is less than 5% probability that the findings are due to random chance.

1 - Quiz
How many participants are typically needed for a study to be considered a "large randomised trial"?

**Answer**: It's actually subjective. The claim of our paper is that it is large randomised trial. Because, no previous study of this kind has taken around 300 participants in the study. 

2 - Quiz
What is salivary cortisol?
**Answer:** Salivary cortisol is a measure of the hormone cortisol found in saliva, often used to assess stress levels. Cortisol, known as the “stress hormone,” is produced by the adrenal glands and helps regulate various bodily functions, including metabolism, immune response, and the body’s response to stress. Salivary cortisol is a non-invasive way to measure cortisol levels and reflects the body’s immediate stress response, as cortisol can quickly move from the bloodstream into saliva. Elevated salivary cortisol levels typically indicate increased stress or activation of the body’s “fight-or-flight” response.

*What is invasive method of measuring Cortisol level?*
An invasive way to measure cortisol levels involves collecting blood samples, which requires a needle to draw blood from a vein. This method is considered invasive because it penetrates the skin and can cause discomfort, risk of infection, or stress in some individuals.

3 - Quiz
What is IL-6?
**Answer:** **Interleukin-6 (IL-6)** is a type of cytokine, which is a protein involved in immune system signalling. IL-6 is essential in controlling infections and repairing damage, its overproduction can lead to chronic inflammation. Elevated levels of IL-6 have been associated with chronic diseases like heart disease, and some cancers.
- In psychophysiological studies, IL-6 is used as a **biomarker of stress and inflammation**. Increased levels of IL-6 can indicate prolonged stress or inflammation, providing an objective measure of physiological stress.
- In the context of cancer, high IL-6 levels have been associated with fatigue, depression, and poorer outcomes, as the inflammation it signals may promote cancer progression.

5 - Quiz
Which of these is a common method used to measure stress in
psychophysiological studies?
**Answer:** Give smartwatch example.

6 - Quiz
**Answer:** What does “intervention” mean in a scientific study?
In a scientific study, an **intervention** is a deliberate action or treatment introduced to study its effects on participants. This could be a therapy, medication, lifestyle change, or program (like mindfulness training). Researchers measure outcomes before and after the intervention to determine if it causes any changes, helping assess its effectiveness or impact.

7 - Quiz
In research, what is a control group?
**Answer:** A group that doesn’t receive the treatment, used for comparison

8 - Quiz
What is the purpose of a hypothesis in scientific research?
**Answer:** To provide a testable prediction about a research question.
In scientific research, a **hypothesis** is a testable prediction about the relationship between variables. It guides the study by providing a focused question to investigate and helps determine if the expected outcome occurs, thus supporting or challenging existing theories.
