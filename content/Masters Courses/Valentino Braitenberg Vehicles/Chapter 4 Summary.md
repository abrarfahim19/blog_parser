In the chapter 4 it's all chaos. The lower versions of the vehicles had a rule common in them, `The velocity with respect to the source was linear`. That means it was either:
1. The more the sensory input the `more` the velocity 
2. The more the sensory input the `mere` the velocity

But in this proposed vehicle, `Braitenberg` proposes the velocity of the vehicle would not be linear. It would ascend to peak and then descend to 0. That would be like a `Bell Curve`.

Just adding this factor in to the vehicles velocity, we can easily see that the vehicle can make all sorts of `zig-zag`, `8-shaped` or even `circular` path around the source. And obviously by adding more of the sensors we will likely have more randomness in the environment.

Vehicle 4 is a truly remarkable one. If one who doesn't know about the intricacy of the vehicles, might think the vehicle is making decision about the next move it will make. And once it makes a decision it executes it. And the moves are definitely not so obvious.

> [!tip] Hot-Take: If there is a decision making then, theres a will. And if the vehicle is making a decision than it must have a free will 

But then again, theres nothing that, we didn't put into the vehicle. But why the knowledge of it's inner working makes us doubt it's free will? If the definition of free will is as follows:

_Does vehicle 4 have free will?_
