### Compatibility
Compatibility (`kafa'a`) in marriage is extremely important for a prosperous and lasting marriage. This refers to religious, temperamental and intellectual compatibility.

Marry someone who has a similar religious background, temperament and nature to you. Someone who shares your interests in life - like reading, someone of a similar level of intellectual capability with whom you can connect and are able to understand. Although being from the same caste/ethnicity can help a marriage, it does not 'necessarily' mean that you are compatible. Some couples have the same mother tongue, yet they speak different languages; others have different mother tongues, but speak the same language!

### Look on the bright side
For indeed we as human are not free from fault. The prophetic way is to look at the glass as "Half-full". 

>Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “**A believing man does not despise a believing woman. If he finds something in her character he dislikes, he will be pleased by something else.**”

### Akhlakh and Ihsaan

And Rasullah Sw. warned us about the right of women:

### Beauty and Subjectivity

Beauty itself is subjective. What Imam meant here is, _The person you marry will be the comfort of your eyes. Social/Cultural norm is the variable_

> Conceal the key to your heart.
![[Ibn Taymiyyah on loving unrestrictedly.png]]

> May Allah ease the affairs of the Muslims. We pray to Allah by his glory and majesty, to grant you a pious wife. Who can please you eyes in this duniya and the akhirah. A wife who fears Allah alongside you & is obedient to Allah. And may Allah grant you righteous offspring.
