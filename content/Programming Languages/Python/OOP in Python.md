> [!info] Python doesn't have abstraction it uses inheritance to solve this

There are four principle of OOP:
1. Inheritance - Creating a new class which is derivative of an existing class
2. Polymorphism - The ability of a function to change its behaviour when called by different objects
3. Encapsulation - Limiting access to method and variables by encasing them in a single unit of scope.
4. Abstraction - Hides implementation details for security

There are many more important concepts in OOP such as:
1. Method Overloading
2. Method Overriding
3. Constructors
.... So on

> [!tip] Everything in python is an object or derived from object class

### Abstract Class
1. Can have one or more abstract method
2. Child of Abstract Class: Can only be instantiated if all the abstract method are overridden.

> [!note] The abstract class can be defined without using a abstractmethod
