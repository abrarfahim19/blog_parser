For now I am going to use the OpenAI API.

1. I got the API key working from OpenAI. ✅
2. For a query I get a response using the Langchain ✅
3. But it can't do
	1. Can't remember the previous conversation ✅
		1. As I did it it remembers all the conversation. But I want to limit it. ✅
	2. From external document I want it to be able to response ✅
		1. I want the document to be looked/searched with Vector search. Elastic Search would be great. But for now, the OpenAIEmbeddings will do.  ✅
	3. Tell me the current weather ✅
		1. I want it to understand which is the location from the text with Agent. I don't want to hardcode it
