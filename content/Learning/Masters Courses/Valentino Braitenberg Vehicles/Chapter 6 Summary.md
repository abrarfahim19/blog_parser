This chapter summary in one line:
> System learns by elimination

We just try to create our vehicle. And then copy it and put it in to the playground. Some will die, some will survive. And then from the survivors we will copy a new generation. But we are bound to make honest mistake. It should not come as surprise that, the ones that we copied from has fallen. But the copy did not. Such is creativity. It is mysterious and surprising.

This does sound like the simulation of `Malthusian growth model`. We have to lookout for the balance of population. But there is no predator. It would be nice to have some `Destroyer` that kills the vehicles. May be we can take the inspiration from `Vehicle 2B`  and inside each vehicle there will be a source the destroyer wants. It heads right to it. And smash on to it. Or one could say,
> It devours the vehicle

And may be we can take inspiration from 2A and say that there is something of a source inside the `Destroyer` the vehicles always `fear`. So they want to run away from it.

Ultimately the system may come into equilibrium. But a minor drift in the environment, just a gush of wind can make all the difference. Everything may go crazy. The sound of metal colliding... Just like a battle between `Autobots` and `Decepticon` will break out... And only the strong will remain. And the system as a whole will improve over time.
