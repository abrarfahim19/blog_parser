`Braitenberg` had different angle of looking into intelligence. Apart from `Alan Turing's` Turing test. He asked why would verbal communication be the prerequisite of intelligence? Can it not be that this is fully about the behaviour. And in his book he set out to recreate these behaviour. Even though it was simple and almost equivalent of one line code. These subtle changes bring about many interesting behaviour. Some of the behaviour is indeed sign of intelligence. But, we are the one who made up these vehicle versions. So, there are also philosophical debates about what is intelligence.

We used `Unreal Engine` to create the vehicles. It was a fun lab. And the live discussion was my favourite. I try to stay on the corner of a class. And don't respond much. But this was so much intriguing for me that I ended up participating on the discussion a lot and the professor during my presentation appreciated my contribution to the class.
