title: Valentino Braitenberg Vehicles Experiments in Synthetic Psychology Chapter 1
---

I suppose I saw a movie when I was very young. There was a scene in the film where some guy was electrocuting a dead frog's feet in the water. With the twitch of the muscle, the guy shouted, "It's alive!". Reading the last line of Chapter 1 reminded me of that scene.

With some googling (asking ChatGPT) I found it's from the book "Frankenstein". Yes surely. Maybe I saw an adaptation of the book. I can't say for sure, but the author might have hinted at the same "Frankenstein" reference. I don't know what vehicle will be built finally, but will it be like "The Creature" Dr. Frankenstein built? Despite the outward appearance, will our vehicle be highly intelligent and also carry deep emotions?

And what makes a being intelligent? What counts as emotion? Are we kind enough to call "The creature" intelligent? Is it because it looks like Dr. Frankenstein? The monster is not even given any name in the book! But comes as capable of complex emotion. What if our vehicle doesn't look anything like any living being?

If the vehicle does just one thing will it be considered intelligent? In Chapter 1, the vehicle 1 has just one sensor and one motor. The greater the force, the faster the motor runs. If we consider friction, this relatively simple vehicle becomes very interesting. Its movement will be similar to "Brownian Motion".
