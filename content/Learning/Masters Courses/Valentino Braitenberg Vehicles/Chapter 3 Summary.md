So there are tree types of variation in Vehicle 3:
1. Straight Connection 3(a): Moves toward the source in a loving and gentle way
2. Crossed Connection 3(b): Moves past the source and face away from it
3. Complex Connection 3(c): With multiple sensory inputs (such as, light, temperature, oxygen concentration) it starts to have `Values` or `Preferences`. It "dislikes" some certain environments and prefer other environments.

Let's name `vehicle 3`,  `Wall-E`.
`Wall-E` has sensors (like eyes) and wheels (like legs), and the way these parts are wired together makes it behave in ways that look almost... affectionate (humane). I would like to imagine it like this: if `Wall-E` *sees* a light or *feels* warmth, it moves toward the source, but it doesn't just runs straight in like a mindless zombie. Its approach is pretty much loving and affectionate.

### Illusion of Knowledge:
Just when we start to root for `Wall-E` and start to feel like theres a flow of information, `Braitenberg` reminds us:

>[!info] There was no such transmission of information here. We were just playing with sensors, motors, and connections. 

Also we can just create an enormous amount of variation with the number of sensors and the tuning of the sensors. It can have all sorts of variation in movement. And how do we actually store knowledge into the system? May be will see more of it in the upcoming chapters!
