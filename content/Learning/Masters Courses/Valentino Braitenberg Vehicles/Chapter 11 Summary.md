In chapter 11 `Braitenberg` talks about two points mainly:
1. Learning Patterns (**Sequential Learning with Ergotrix**): Vehicles use **Ergotrix wire** to learn and predict event sequences. Like the example of lighting before thunder. It teaches/enables them to recognise casual relationships and then predict/anticipate(?) future events that would likely occur.

2. Connecting Ideas and Actions (**Concept-Rule Interdependence**): Concept formation (via `Mnemotrix`) and understanding event sequences (via `Ergotrix`) are interconnected. Well, it's a becoming more abstract now... This helps them act smarter/intelligently(?), like reacting to warnings before something happens.
