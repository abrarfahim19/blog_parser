Chapter 12 `Trains of Thought` states the mechanism of thinking. So `Braitenberg` try to draw distinction between simple learning and  `Actual thinking`. And when a concept is activated the Egotrix wires lead to the next Egotrix. ANd he gave an example of planing a route by moving through landmarks. So this is experienced based concept. Thinking should lead to attaining of knowledge right? Then first we have to know what knowledge is.  knowledge can be divided into two types:

1. **Priori**: 2+2 = 4 is universal mathematical truth. They are inside or innate derived from reason and logic.
2. **Posteriori**: knowledge that come from experience. like we observed that "Water boils at 100 Degree"

And two types of concept form from these knowledge:
1. **Noumenon**: The reality that exist within? (Priori)
2. **Phenomenon**: Observable events. (Posteriori)

So, we can have sequential thought via Associative chains using these types of concept. and adding on top of each other.  We can have lifelike cognitive from feedback driven, associative neural networks.

**In chapter 13**, he talks about `Foresight`. What does it mean?
> **Foresight** (/ˈfɔːsʌɪt/): the ability to predict what will happen or be needed in the future.

Here the vehicle has predictor wired with the Ergotrix that can replay the events. When it sees a familiar event, it runs through the possible outcome and compare them with the input. and update the internal model if it doesn't match.

**In chapter 14**, he talks about `Egotism and Optimism`. What does these term mean?
> **Egotism** (/ˈiːɡətɪz(ə)m,ˈɛɡətɪz(ə)m/): the fact of being excessively conceited or absorbed in oneself.
> 
> “Once we have noticed this, we can of course, in a last creative effort, endow a new kind of vehicle, our last, Vehicle 14, with a certain amount of systematic egotism, with a touch of the pleasure principle, in order to make it look more like our fellow humans.”

> **Optimism** (/ˈɒptɪmɪz(ə)m/): hopefulness and confidence about the future or the success of something.
> 
> “We will now give this process an optimistic slant so that the pump of thoughts in the brain of the vehicle will produce a succession of more and more pleasurable mental images.”

In summary vehicle 14 combines all the modifications from the previous chapter and as a final touch takes/picks the most pleasing future from several possible predictions. And it is `Optimism` or `Goal driven way` which is much like a person chasing a heartfelt desired outcome.

>(I think using these word like `heartfelt` makes it feel like we are talking about one of us. In principle they are quite like us in many ways.

Now if I am asked,
> Is the vehicle alive?
>- I am not sure. What do `you` think? What is life? One could  classify based on Biological construction. Any thing that can reproduce life is alive. And say it is not alive

If I am asked again,
> Do you think this vehicle is intelligent?
> - ... If intelligence means `Ability of Getting Around Freely, Having Fear and Aggression, Love, Values and Special Tastes, Logic, Selection, Concepts, Space–Things–and Movements, Shapes Understanding, Getting Ideas, Rules and Regularities, Trains of Thought, Foresight, Egotism and Optimism`. Yes.

> N.B: I believe if I read this book again, I might get different understanding. Because the idea of the book is very abstract. But underlying theme is: We don't always need a super elegant solution to achieve efficiency. A simple rule/change can suffice.
