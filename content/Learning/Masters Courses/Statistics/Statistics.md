Statistics is the fundamental of Machine Learning. The course work was very broad. But the exam was relatively easy. I wasn't sure where the teacher would ask the questions from. But course was designed to help the students familiarise the students with the concepts of Statistics. Namely:
1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Probability Calculus (Independence, Bayes' theorem, Probability Distribution Function etc)
3. Inductive Statistics (hypothesis testing etc.)

Same outline from the course:
- [[Conditional Probability and Independence]]
