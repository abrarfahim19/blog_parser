Breast cancer survivors often experience chronic psychological and physiological stress after completing treatment​. Prolonged stress can dysregulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to elevated levels of cortisol and inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6), which have been linked to poorer health outcomes (e.g., fatigue, depression, and even cancer progression)​. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a meditation-based program shown to alleviate stress, anxiety, fatigue, and other symptoms in cancer survivors​ . However, prior to this study it was unclear whether MBSR produces measurable changes in objective stress biomarkers such as salivary cortisol and IL-6​. **Lengacher et al. (2019)** address this gap by investigating the effects of a tailored MBSR program for breast cancer survivors on these biomarkers in a large randomized controlled trial (RCT). The authors also examined how changes in cortisol and IL-6 relate to patients’ symptoms and quality of life​
